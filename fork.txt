Sure, let's go through the step of forking a child process in detail.

The `fork()` system call is used to create a new process, called a child process, from an existing process, called the parent process. When `fork()` is called, it creates an exact copy of the parent process, including its code, data, and stack.

Here's how the `fork()` system call works:

1. **Calling `fork()`**: The parent process calls the `fork()` system call to create a new child process.

```c
pid_t pid = fork();
```

2. **Return Values**: The `fork()` system call returns two different values, depending on whether you are in the parent process or the child process:
   - In the parent process, `fork()` returns the process ID (PID) of the newly created child process.
   - In the child process, `fork()` returns 0.

```c
if (pid == -1) {
    // Error handling: fork() failed
} else if (pid == 0) {
    // Child process
} else {
    // Parent process
}
```

3. **Separate Execution**: After the `fork()` call, the parent and child processes continue to execute independently. The child process is an exact copy of the parent process at the time of the `fork()` call, but it has its own memory space and can modify its own variables without affecting the parent process.

4. **Resource Sharing**: The child process inherits many of the parent process's resources, such as open files, signal handlers, and environment variables. However, the child process has its own process ID, parent process ID, and other process-specific attributes.

5. **Termination**: When the child process finishes executing, it terminates and returns an exit status to the parent process. The parent process can then use the `wait()` or `waitpid()` system calls to wait for the child process to terminate and retrieve its exit status.

By forking a child process, you can create a new process that can run concurrently with the parent process, allowing you to take advantage of multiprocessing and perform tasks in parallel.
